First of all we want to give you all the files you need.

## Task

Therefore start with cloning the repository corresponding with this lesson.

`git clone https://github.com/niklasapholz/katacoda-scenarios.git`{{execute}}

Switch directories into the repository and you find a few python scripts and an example JSON.

`cd fit_data_to_db`{{execute}}

Now we finished our preparation! In the next step we will start our PostgreSQL.
